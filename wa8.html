<h1>Step 1</h1>
<a href="Homework 8 .html">Code for step 1</a>
<p>The code finds the mean for both vehicular and pedestrian stops within the data set. Filters through the dataset to find the totals for both vehicular and pedestrian stops. Then takes a look at which average stop was higher, vehicular or pedestrian. </p>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>The Denver police are more likely to make a vehicular stop than a pedestrian stop based off of the data. This is because vehicular stops account for more than half of the stops made by Denver police. This indicates that there are more wreckless drivers or danger on the streets via vehicles than there is by pedestrian. Explanations of this are that the Denver police have the largest police force in all of Colorado which leads to more patroling, more coverage, and quicker response times. Also Denver is a compact area where speeding, road rage, illegal vehicular activity can take place more frequently due to slower speed limits than other places in Colorado, compact driving situations, and harder places to find parking. I also think that police are patroling more via vehicle than by foot. My question for future analysis is based on different counties which county in Colorado has the most amount of vehicular stops? This will provide a deeper understanding of the vehicular stops made by police and tell us if Denver has a higher percentage of vehicular stops or a lower percentage within the whole state. </p>
