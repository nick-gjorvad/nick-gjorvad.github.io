<h2 class="center", id="green_text_color">Breaking Bad, The Highest Rated TV Show On Netflix And The Best Show Ever</h2>
<p class="font1"> In 2008, one of the best shows was released for the viewership of the human race, but very little people knew or even heard about it. That show was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">Breaking Bad</a>. Breaking Bad is Netflix's highest rated TV show ever and is arguably one of the best shows never created by Netflix. With a relatable everyday character known as Walter White and his younger student and partner in crime Jesse Pinkman, these two created a dynamic duo that left viewers at home wishing they could join the drug creating and selling business. I am using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ritesh2000/trending-tv-shows-on-netflix">"'Trending TV Shows on Netflix dataset'"</a> to help me argue my point that Breaking Bad is the greatest show ever. This dataset has data on 50 of the most popular and highest rated Netflix shows of all time. The dataset provides data on the shows that are still currently on and no longer on Netflix, the year the show was released, title of the show, and the Netflix age rating for the show. Even to this day Breaking Bad is still on Netflix being adored for first time viewers and rewatched by long time fans, securing the top rated spot of all Netflix TV shows. </p>

<p class="font1"> Breaking Bad first came out in 2008 only airing on AMC at first, until a partnership was established allowing Breaking Bad to air on the famous streaming service known as Netflix. When the show first came out the viewership was really low on AMC, but then once the show reached Netflix the viewership skyrocketed to nearly 5x the amount of views it previously had on AMC alone. With its introduction to Netflix came along with very high ratings and praise for the show. The so-called <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/14/21312595/netflix-breaking-bad-podcast-streaming-land-of-the-giants">"Netflix effect"</a> helped take Breaking Bad to new heights of popularity. "AMC insists that Netflix was just one of the reasons Breaking Bad got so big"(Molla, Kafka, 2020). </p>

<p class="font1"> Breaking Bad was still being filmed when it first came on Netflix, so fans all over the world would wait a gap of a year and a half for a new season to release on the streaming service. This caused massive popularity and anxious viewers waiting to find out what happens next to our favorite dynamic duo of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. The show was able to connect and develop personal relationships with the main characters of the show. This in turn made it easy for the producers to showcase new twists and turns that left the viewers on the edge of their seat. The whole premise of the story that is told within 5 separate series showcases violent, action packed, gruesome, and beautiful scenes that will for sure stick in viewers mind for the rest of their life. The storyline is what makes this show so entertaining and hard to put down, but it also helps to have such amazing acting performances from the lead characters; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186505/">"Bryan Cranston"</a> who plays Walter White and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0666739/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">"Aaron Paul"</a> who plays Jesse Pinkman. </p>

<p class="font1"> Nowadays with the pandemic going on and not being able to go outside, people are turning to online streaming services for the cure to boredom. This in turn has caused Breaking Bad to be watched for first time viewers and those who have already watched the series. Streaming services are also taking the world by storm which allows for more and more people to watch Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is arguably one of the best shows ever created and having a <b>9.5 out of 10 stars</b>(according to my dataset), makes it the highest rated Netflix TV show for now. However, according to the data, there are not that many shows in the same league as breaking bad and only so many shows have gotten close to its near perfect rating. With the pandemic hitting, people are more and more curious to watch new shows and Breaking Bad is almost surely to be recommended to new and old viewers by Netflix. Based on the dataset, the ratings show that both new and old viewers really enjoy Breaking Bad and that in turn supports my case that it is one of the best shows ever created. Those who have seen the show always rejoice and have nothing but good to say about it, however, if you are still not convinced that Breaking Bad is the best show, here is a beautifully well thought out article as to why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allenstjohn/2013/09/16/why-breaking-bad-is-the-best-show-ever-and-why-that-matters/?sh=5d066609650e">"Breaking Bad is the best show ever."</a> </p>

<p class="font1"> It is known that Breaking Bad is the best show ever created and all of the sources I have included, along with Breaking Badâ€™s killer fanbase can agree that it is the best. If you still have not seen the show, now is the time to watch it and enjoy the crazy story that Walter and Jesse set off on.</p>

<p> From the graph above and the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ritesh2000/trending-tv-shows-on-netflix">"Trending TV Shows on Netflix dataset"</a> that I used to gather my data, I established that the highest rated TV show on Netflix is Breaking Bad and the <b>average </b>rating score for shows on Netflix is a 8.72 out of 10 stars. </p>
