<h1>Weekly Assignment 3</h1>
<h2 class="center-align">My Modified Essay</h2>
<p class="tab">	As an information science student there have been a lot of different stories/themes that have occurred in the world revolving around technology, especially connecting to the craziness of the stock market Gamestop story. These stories/themes showcasing the good and the bad of technology, the internet, and popular social platforms. As time has gone on I have realized that there should be no limits when it comes to social platforms, platforms should have the responsibility to protect themselves and their users data, and humanity should be decently afraid of what technology has done and will do in the future as it evolves.  
</p>
<p class="tab">	There are currently no limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action and truthfully, there should not be any. These social platforms mainly Reddit for this example are designed to connect people with one another in a way humanity has never experienced before. This in turn causes a lot of people collectively gathering together to plan and achieve a common goal. Sometimes this goal is evil and something that causes a lot of controversy, but most of the time these social platforms provide a lot of good. I personally am a part of a lot of social platforms and within those social platforms there are a lot of different unique groups that coordinate together to collectively come together to achieve a common goal. Reddit is a great example of this because there are thousands to hundreds of thousands of different subreddits that people connect on and share a common interest through. Like I explain later on in this essay, technology, the internet, and platforms are designed to help humanity, but there are people or even groups that use it for bad intentions. That should not stop people from participating in social platform groups because some groups of people use it for bad purposes. Social platforms are very powerful tools and humanity is quickly evolving thanks to the help of technology, so there is no way to limit social platforms currently and that is okay. If these groups commit a crime, do something illegal, etc. they will be prosecuted and the law system will take care of them. I do not think it is the platform's responsibility to do that or limit its user base. The platform should operate and be of service to all of its users whenever and however it is needed. </p>

<p class="tab"> Platforms have the responsibility to protect themselves along with protecting its users data. These are the two responsibilities that a platform has to achieve, everything else goes. Platforms are growing so rapidly these days that it is almost impossible to monitor every single profile on the platform. Humanity does not have the technology or man power to do that and for that reason the platform should only be responsible for protecting its users data. This is because this is something that the platform can control, the platform has access and can implement rules, precautions, and security to make sure that no one can gather or steal data/information from or on users that are using the platform. As for being responsible for protecting the platform itself, the platform needs to make sure that they cover themselves first before anything. This is because if the platform cannot responsibly protect themselves, how are they going to protect its users or anything for that matter? How they protect themselves is up to the platform, but they need to be sure that they protect the platform from everything that can potentially harm it.  
</p>
<p class="tab"> With technology and the internet constantly evolving over time, as an information science student I have come to notice a lot of activity that has both excited and scared me throughout history. At the beginning of the technological era I felt excited and anxious to see what would come next. Whether that be a nice piece of physical handheld technology like a smartphone or a new app/platform that would change the way humanity lived. I was always so excited and could not sleep due to the anticipation for what would come next. I was always blown away by the creativity and beauty that technology and online platforms bring. However, I started to get older and began to study information technology at The University of Colorado Boulder and year after year news would come to light about certain platforms or pieces of technology that cause harm to people, to companies, to the world. I started to slowly become less excited and optimistic and rather scared, uneasy, and fearful of what is going to come next for humanity and the world. I started to notice a common theme or a trend when it comes to technology and that is as technology evolves so do people along with the good and the bad of that evolution. Technology is meant to help humanity, but some people use it to hurt others. Some manage to find a back door when it comes to technology, the internet, or platforms and they manipulate it to their advantage. This was clearly showcased with the Reddit, Robinhood, Gamestop, Stock market incident. This is what I am scared of because humans are not perfect and when they create/develop something, they cannot predict what their creation can and will be used for. The creators have a hope and an idea for what their creation is meant to be used for, but there are people out there who want to use their creation for a completely different reason. This is something that is impossible to prevent and this in turn causes a lot of scary topics that we all have seen in the news today and the past. 
</p>
<p class="tab">	In conclusion, humanity is evolving with the help of technology and with that we need to be able to accept the fact that we cannot control everything. Robinhood, Reddit, the stock market, Gamestop, etc. have all prospered due to technology, but sometimes things get out of hand and certain incidents occur due to the exploitation of platforms, technology, etc. Technology is going to surpass humanity eventually, but for now let's enjoy it and see what happens. Bad things happen everyday no matter if you are a billionaire or a poor individual who enjoys going on Reddit and potentially cashing out big on Gamestop shares. Everyday is a new day and the possibilities with technology are endless, let’s just hope things don’t get too out of hand.</p>
